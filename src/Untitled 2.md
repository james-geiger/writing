A palm tree by the shore
catches the ocean wind like
the mast of one of the sailboats
dotting the water.

Each palm leaf acting in
concert to sway the long,
slender trunk.  In a light
breeze, the fronds sway as though
dancing on the horizon.

Even the dead leaves, now
slouching, upside-down, browned
by the oppressive sunlight,
follow along to this
swingy two-step, though
with less vigor than their
green partners.

How the tree wants rid of
them, these markers of seasons
well past!  But they hang on,
in defiance of the tree, day by
day, until finally one, maybe
two, fall to the earth in the
wake of a strong gust.

Lighter now, the palm sways
a bit more freely, unburdened
of the responsibility of the
past.  Freer to dance, to caress
the breeze, to grow into the future,
like a teenager on the cusp of his life.
