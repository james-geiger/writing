Tonight I am at war with nobody but myself.
Introspection revealing only more to be discerned.

Children, as they sleep, process new information into memories.
Adults, while their children sleep, contemplate their future, and, in doing so, contemplate their own—

How is one to arrest the mountain of the everyday doldrum,
that which keeps us marching steadily along toward the solitude of death?

What should I do now to overcome the weight of living,
to commune with God while still here,
to signal to the fireflies—
lacking my own light—
I understand.
