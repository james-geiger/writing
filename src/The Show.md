I need to settle into my seat
the show is about to begin.
Shift from left to right—ah, there—
adjust my coffee to be a bit nearer,
blow on it to cool, a futile effort—
can my breath do anything to cool it down?

Ssh, the curtain is up! I've been anticipating
today's playbill. The light from the sun,
now about eight minutes old, reveals 
a hummingbird darting from stem to stem,
flower to flower.  It illuminates the steam
from my cup rising ever so slightly.  I watch,
captivated, as it hangs in the air, sinks, then
peculiarly dissolves into the atmosphere.

Have I seen this tree before, now lit in a new,
particular way?  Her greens and browns and yellows
seem so new—different, at least—in today's
magnificent light.  Even the ground, normally a
dullard, is playing a leading role in this show.
A pigeon enters stage left practically shimmering
in her costume of grey, purple and green necklace
enticing the light to catch it at just the right angle.

I don't want this show to end, for me to
rise from my seat and move into the mezzanine
of what this day or the next could bring. I want to
join the cast and tour this perfect world—
this undulating beauty, dancing in the light
day after day, just below our perception.
