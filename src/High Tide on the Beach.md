What could match the beauty of
beholding an ocean wave
crashing into the shore—
violently attacking the rocks,
spray flinging itself into the air?

Consider the match of two fighters
trading blows in the ring,
some punches landing, others dodged,
their fists flinging blood into the air
in a spectacular, grotesque horror.

Each of them knows the rules,
however barbaric, and the nature of
their winner-take-all sport; but neither
knows who in the end will fall, waking
shortly to find the match concluded, lost.

How remarkably the shore resists the
tumult of the sea day after day,
wave after wave, holding back the tide,
greedy as it is, from drowning the land
under the depths of its dark blue.

This fight will go on, water against stone,
without a clear conclusion; its destiny
set from the beginning: jagged rock softening,
rounding, eroding into bits of sand until
comes eternity—that dark, mysterious place.
