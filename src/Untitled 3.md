The dead do not celebrate their birthdays—
at least—not in the same way we do.

Yet there you are, celebratory balloons in hand,
standing over one of thousands of markers.

Today must have been the day, a few months ago,
when they were blowing out fifty six candles on a cake.

Now today it's your turn to be breathless—
longing, overwhelmed by your sense of grief.

It's not been long; you can still count the missed
moments, phone calls, shared meals, embraces—

The balloons dance in the wind, shimmering joyfully
in the bit of sun peeking through the clouds.

Your grasp loosens on one as it gets caught up in a gust,
floating slowly now up towards the heavens—

How it ached to be free.  So did they, our honorees,
rudely sleeping, ignoring us, missing all the fun.

They float far above our solemn heads now—like the
balloon does as it is carried skyward by the wind.

The wind has called them all home—finally slack from
the Earth—dancing in the cool, cloud filled sky,

blissfully resting in the beauty of what comes next.
The dead to not celebrate their birthdays.
