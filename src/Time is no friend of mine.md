Time is no friend of mine,
his hammer and chisel
chipping away against
the marble of my life.

He seems to lack,
from what I can tell,
a cohesive vision for
this latest work of his.
Perhaps this stone is
faulty, irregular soft and
hard spots, cracks, bizarre
fissures—the quarry to blame.

Though, I don't think
this is the case. Time,
from what I can tell,
never went to school,
never was an apprentice,
never studied sculpture,
never even practiced before
now, after having found
this mallet of his—by
sheer luck—smashing it against
me with a wanton abandon—
tick, tick, tick—
taking chips off of me
without regard to me,
my desires, my vision—
without artistry of any kind.
