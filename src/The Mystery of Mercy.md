**The Mystery of Mercy**

1.

Staring into the vast empty
blue of the sky, suddenly I was
arrested by the overwhelming
heaviness of being alive.

My body began to dissolve into
its elements, breath to vapor,
body to earth, spirit to sky, my
awareness slowly weightless.

2.

It is an impossible thing, to look at your
parents as an adult, and forgive them
their many faults, and let it go.

I don’t mean the kind of forgiveness when,
after pushing someone down as a kid, you
half-heartedly and with a tongue of sarcasm 
you didn’t yet understand, apologize, and are
told by your victim that your stupid,
thoughtless, childish actions were excused.

I mean the kind of forgiveness where you
won’t ever get an apology.  The kind of
forgiveness where the thing you’re forgiving
is the sin of being alive, of making countless
mistakes, of trying one’s best—no matter how
callous and absurdly shit was the attempt.

3.

Consciousness formed into cloud,
shifting and billowing and dancing
a great choreographed ballet as
it was perfectly meant to be.

Telling the story of unspeakable beauty,
of horrifying tragedy, grief, and sorrow.
Of struggle, of joy, of delight—
past, present, future.

4.

No amount of therapy, of abstract thought,
reason, will absolve the past.  No amount
of forgiveness will propel us into the future,
healed without the telltale pain and
scars of the past.  Only just and glorious
mercy, the thing we don’t have, sourced
from outside our impossible ego.

How else could we move past the flawed,
irreparable perception of our child self?
No part of the brain—in all its dendrites
and synapses and chemicals and salt
and fat and potassium and electrons—seems
to hold this thing called true grace. I’ve looked.

5.

The scenes set like a play,
actors with lines memorized,
water vapor perfectly portraying birth,
death, in their due time.

Why should this be happening now,
known to my body but not my
consciousness, the parts of my life
that must happen, no matter what?

6.

And what does it really mean to let something
go, anyway?  Is that truly what we want?
To release the way we feel into thin air,
forgotten, “let go,” but never fully gone?
Tattoo it instead on my forearm in some
invisible ink, carried with me and known
only to me and only in the way I can know.


What could be more freeing than true
acceptance, of integration with the self.
Could it be my struggles and pain are
only so when I allow them to be?

7.

Imagine then, the feeling of my 
becoming aware, once again,
of myself, sky without a cloud,
but the remains of overwhelming grief.

Should I twitch my fingers,
move my feet, breathe?
Should I feel the sun on my face,
the grass beneath my back, air?

Maybe I’ll give thanks for a moment,
to whomever or whatever will listen,
for my being alive, I think, or instead,
perhaps, the mercy of a new day.
