Even meteorologists don't completely
understand how tornadoes form—
he so confidently asserted, though
himself not a meteorologist— but
for the moment at least struck the
kind of tone only earnest people strike—
even though he must've misunderstood.

At least, scientifically speaking, they
must know—or should.
But perhaps he meant they don't know
spiritually—though that seems clear, too.




A warm May evening, the kind of day
spend outside despite the unusual heat.
The sunny afternoon fading, a family fresh
in mourning over their dad, granddad,
husband—the dissonant kind only
befitting a departed thorn bush, untamed
rage occasionally surfacing.

His spirit evaporates, catalyzes a cloud,
fueled by the hot moisture and a life spent
at odds with himself—
growing 50,000 feet into the stratosphere, a
feedback loop of rising, falling, rage, calm—
rising
		falling
rage
		calm
reaching fever pitch in some field miles away.

Spirit now cyclone, its own friend and foe,
kicking up dust and throwing around equipment—
the old man wont to do in life.

He'll tire himself out before long, leaving
a familiar path of destruction in his
wake—one final time—before dissipating
just shy of a hog farm, letting up to
move on.  Tired, now, but more suitable—
docile, enough, for the afterlife.

The meteorologists might not have even noticed,
a short-lived twister in the middle of
nowhere, though it served its purpose.
They'll keep watching the sweep on
their monitors, drinking their coffee, the doldrum
of any job—

Though now the spirit's family relieved,
moved on, he was a good man, blah, blah—
and the rest of us left to tidy the mess of
this life—of this storm—and wait to bear the
brunt of the next one
to die without having fully
satisfied that grudge they
held against themself
all these
years

Draft 2 (working)


Clouds having given way to sunshine on this June afternoon,
a family silently sits together on the sunporch, senses
dulled by their recent loss, though noticing the humidity.

Their dad
		granddad
				husband
					    lays in the next room, finally.
His spirit, evaporating in the heat, only adds more moisture to an
environment ripe for rage, catalyzed by the dissonant mourning
for this dearly departed thorn bush—untamed, unpruned, vengeful.

Fueled by hot moisture, instability, a life spent at odds with itself,
this cloud slowly grows fifty thousand feet into the stratosphere,
unbounded by the limitations of ----, 
a cathartic feedback loop of air molecules—

rising
		falling
				rage
						calm reaching its fever pitch in some
proximal field, victim of happenstance,
