Why should I pay attention
to the story that is trending
online?

What making of my fellow man
in frantic consumption
should I give my heaven-sent time?

And only then, hours later,
be made to do it again,
slightly differently, to eternity?

The tides do not care about
trends.  They swell into shore
and out to sea.  They pay no mind
to our ——

Although I may walk along the shore,
shouting, “You really ought to see this!” at the
vast dark blue,
it will not falter its path—
wave after wave, crashing dutifully
upon the shore, not caring an ounce
my trending story,
now into eternity.
